Then we must sort w.r.t. $b_i$, to do this we subdivide $A$ in $S$ subsequences such that each one will contain only tuples of the form $(c, *)$ where $c$ is a constant and $*$ denotes any number, this operation takes $O(n)$ time, finally we sort each of these subsequences using the merge sort algorithm written above, this sorting will take $\\sum_{j=1}^{S} \\Theta(s_j\\log(s_j) = \\Theta(\\sum_{j=1}^{S} s_j\\log(s_j))$ time where we indicated with $s_j$ the length of the $j$-th subsequence, the pseudocode of this algorithm is written below.  \n",

To get a better algorithm we should use a non-comparison based sorting even for the $b_i$, however we don't have neither an upper bound to use counting sort, nor a distribution over $b_i$, which will allow us to use bucket sort. \n",
