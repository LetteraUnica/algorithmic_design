    "In the cell below we implement the heap-based version of the Dijkstra’s algorithm on the Graph data structure written in the file `Graph.py` and using the binary heap defined in `Heap.py`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The heap implements all the methods we saw during the lectures and some more which we found useful during the implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm, in particular it implements a way to decrease a value without needing the index of it in the heap, obviously to accomplish this it needs more space because it needs to store a dictionary that maps a value to a specific index, the key of this mapping is defined by the user. We used this feature in the Dijkstra's algorithm to set as a key the name of the vertex, which is unique in the graph  \n",
    "\n",
    "Designing the graph was more complicated because it can be implemented in different ways, from a high level perspective we chosed to define the graph as a set of vertexes and a vertex as a set of edges, in the implementation however we don't use a set but a dictionary because it allows finding a specific vertex or edge of the graph in $\\Theta(1)$ time on average. Defining the edge as an object is very useful if we want to store additional information about the connection, we didn't use this feature in the code below, however we used the fact that the vertex is an object to add the members v.d, v.prev and v.importance when they were needed. Obviously this implementation requires more space than simply storing a dictionary of {source, destination} pairs, however it allows for a very high generalizability"

    "\n",
    "The code of the bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm can be improved by creating two ad-hoc procedures to build G_up and G_down, in particular in these graphs the connections that go from a vertex with higher importance to one with lower importance are never used, so we could create G_up and G_down with these connections removed by default, this saves both time (we don't have to check if v.importance < u.importance) and space (because we store less connections). We sticked to this implementation because the homework says that the bidirectional Dijkstra has to operate on the graphs decorated by the algorithm at Point 2a, for completeness, below I implement the two procedures to create G_up and G_down like we described above"
