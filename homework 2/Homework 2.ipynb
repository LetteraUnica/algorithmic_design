A naive appoach to this problem would be to perform an exhaustive search across all paths, this would take $O(2^h)$ in the case of a perfectly balanced Red-Black Tree because at each step we must choose to go either left or right and we must take this decision $h$ times, this can be seen as the number of distinct possible sequences of 0s and 1s with length $h$ where 0=right, 1=left.  \n",

    "A better approach can be found by noticing that if I know the height of the right $h_r$ and left $h_l$ child of a node $x$ I can compute the height of $x$ by simply computing $h(x) = \\max(h_l, h_r) + 1 = \\max(h(x.left), h(x.right)) + 1$, the last step gives us a recursive formula to compute the height of any node $x$ and so even of the root of $T$, the base case of this recursion is when I reach a null node, in that case the height is set to -1 because I am \"below\" a leaf node whose height is by definition 0.  \n",

Now suppose it works for the left and right child of a node $x$, we must prove that it works for $x$, indeed we have $height(x) = max(height(x.left), height(x.right)) + 1 = max(h_l, h_r) + 1$ which is the correct result, we take the longest branch and increase it by 1. As far as the complexity is concerned this algorithm will pass through all the nodes only once because each recursive step shifts the problem to the nodes one level below and will compute the same operation each time, so the complexity will be $\\Theta(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree."

    "First of all we reorder $A$ with respect to the first element of the tuple $a_i$ which takes $\\Theta(n+k)$ time with a counting sort algorithm. Then we must sort w.r.t. $b_i$, to do this we subdivide $A$ in $S$ subsequences such that each one will contain only tuples of the form $(c, *)$ where $c$ is a constant and $*$ denotes any number which takes $O(n)$ time, we then sort each of these subsequences using the merge sort algorithm written above, this sorting will take $\\sum_{j=1}^{S} \\Theta(s_j\\log(s_j) = \\Theta(\\sum_{j=1}^{S} s_j\\log(s_j))$ time where we indicated with $s_j$ the length of the $j$-th subsequence.  \n",
