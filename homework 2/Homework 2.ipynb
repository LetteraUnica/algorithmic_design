A naive appoach to this problem would be to perform an exhaustive search across all paths, this would take $O(2^h)$ in the case of a perfectly balanced Red-Black Tree because at each step we must choose to go either left or right and we must take this decision $h$ times, this can be seen as the number of distinct possible sequences of 0s and 1s with length $h$ where 0=right, 1=left.  \n",

As far as the complexity is concerned this algorithm will pass through all the nodes only once because each recursive step shifts the problem to the nodes one level below and will compute the same operation each time, so the complexity will be $\\Theta(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree."
